        <p>Jajangmyeon (자장면) or jjajangmyeon (짜장면) is a Chinese-style Korean noodle dish topped with a thick sauce made
            of
            chunjang, diced pork, and vegetables.[2] It originated in Incheon, Korea where Chinese migrant workers
            started
            making zhajiangmian (noodles served with fried bean sauce) in the late 19th century. Modifications in Korea
            such
            as a darker and sweeter sauce differentiate the Korean dish from the Chinese version. Variants of the dish
            use
            seafood, or other meats.[3][4]

        <p>Gimbap (Korean: 김밥; lit. Gim rice; IPA: [kim.p͈ap̚]), also romanized as kimbap, is a Korean dish made from
            cooked
            rice, vegetables, fish, and meat rolled in gim—dried sheets of seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices.[1]
            The
            origins of gimbap are debated. Some sources suggest it originates from Japanese norimaki, introduced during
            Japanese colonial rule,[2][3][4][5] while others[who?] argue it is a modernized version of bokssam from the
            Joseon era.[6] The dish is often part of a packed meal, or dosirak, to be eaten at picnics and outdoor
            events,
            and can serve as a light lunch along with danmuji (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi. It is a popular
            take-out
            food in South Korea and abroad[7] and is known as a convenient food because of its portability.

        <p>Bibimbap[1] (/ˈbiːbɪmbæp/ BEE-bim-bap,[2] from Korean 비빔밥 [pi.bim.p͈ap̚], literally "mixed rice"), sometimes
            romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish.The term bibim means "mixing" and bap is cooked
            rice. It is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with
            namul (sautéed or blanched seasoned vegetables) and gochujang (chili pepper paste). Egg and sliced meat
            (usually
            beef) are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.[3] In South Korea, Jeonju,
            Jinju,
            and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap.[4] In 2011,
            the dish was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN
            Travel.[5]
